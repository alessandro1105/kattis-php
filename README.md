# Kattis

These are my solutions for [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) problems developed in PHP. Feel free to look at them and take whatever inspiration you need :) These solutions may not be the best or the most elegant but isn't this the purpose of resolving programming problems? To learn to write better code!
